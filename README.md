A data-driven project analyzing road and bridge construction under the PMGSY (Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana)** scheme across Indian states and UTs. This project leverages Python and data visualization tools to uncover insights, monitor progress, and support data-backed decision-making for rural infrastructure development.

ðŸ“Œ Objective
To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and generate meaningful visualizations that highlight the status of road and bridge works (sanctioned, completed, pending), identify regions needing attention, and understand development trends.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
ðŸ“Š Key Insights

Bar Charts for sanctioned/completed projects
Pie Charts for completed vs. pending lengths
Correlation heatmaps
State-wise project status
Histogram distributions for road metrics
India Map visualization (via Excel Maps)
Key Takeaways
Data storytelling helps transform government records into actionable insights
EDA helps identify gaps and strengths in implementation
Visualization is powerful for comparing regional infrastructure statuses
Python is a flexible tool for public infrastructure analysis and reporting
